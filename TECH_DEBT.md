## Architectural

-  **Refine State Management:** The application uses Redux effectively for managing global state. However, some component-level state could be moved to Redux to better manage the application's overall state. For example, the battle state in `components/battle/battle-arena.tsx` (e.g., `selectedPokemon1`, `selectedPokemon2`, `battleResult`) could be managed in the `pokemonSlice` or a new `battleSlice`.

## Code Improvements

-  **Improve Error Handling:** The error handling in the application can be made more robust.
    *   In `lib/tools/battle-simulator.ts`, the `simulatePokemonBattle` function has a generic `catch` block. It would be better to handle specific errors (e.g., Pokemon not found) and provide more informative error messages.
    *   The UI should provide clear feedback to the user when an error occurs, such as when a Pok√©mon cannot be found or a battle simulation fails.

-  **Strengthen Typing:** The codebase has a few instances of `any` and `unknown` types that should be replaced with more specific types.
    *   In `components/battle/battle-arena.tsx`, `pokemon as unknown as PokemonData` is used. This type assertion should be avoided. The state should be structured in a way that makes this unnecessary.
    *   The `ToolCall` interface in `lib/features/chat/chatSlice.ts` uses `any` for the `result` property. This could be a generic type to provide better type safety.
