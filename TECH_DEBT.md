## Code Improvements

-  **Improve Error Handling:** The error handling in the application can be made more robust.
    *   In `lib/tools/battle-simulator.ts`, the `simulatePokemonBattle` function has a generic `catch` block. It would be better to handle specific errors (e.g., Pokemon not found) and provide more informative error messages.
    *   The UI should provide clear feedback to the user when an error occurs, such as when a Pok√©mon cannot be found or a battle simulation fails.
