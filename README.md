I think that as a general the challenging thing was the correct stream handling so it would be fed correctly into the chat component. So I decided to wrap the stream response from the API service on a hook to have a reasonable way to pass the stream in any part of the application.

Apart from that I think the architecture is pretty straightforward. I decided to use Redux for managing the state application to make it more robust and there's a minimal service layer for the poke and Anthropic APIs.
